# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our project a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone.  
We are committed to fostering a friendly, safe, and inclusive environment for all people.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate in communication
- Offering helpful and constructive feedback
- Gracefully accepting feedback or disagreement
- Showing empathy and kindness to others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, bullying, or discriminatory remarks
- Posting offensive or inappropriate content
- Personal attacks or insults
- Disruptive or antagonistic comments
- Trolling, flame wars, or intentionally derailing discussions

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct.

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, our Discord server, and any other community platforms — and also applies when an individual is representing the project officially.

## Enforcement

Violations may be reported by opening an issue, contacting the maintainers directly, or via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/helpchat). All reports will be reviewed and investigated.

Reports will be handled with discretion, and any actions taken will be appropriate to the situation.
