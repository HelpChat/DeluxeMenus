# Information
[DeluxeMenus][spigot] is the all in one inventory GUI menu plugin!
You can create GUI menus that open with custom commands that will show stats or perform actions specific to the player who opened it. Your menus are fully configurable. You can create menus that show specific items to different players, or perform different actions depending on what javascript requirement they have for the specific slot in a certain GUI.

DeluxeMenus depends on [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).

If you would like to contribute towards DeluxeMenus should you take a look at our [Contributing file][contributing] for the ins and outs on how you can do that and what you need to keep in mind.

## Click cooldown

`click_cooldown_ms` in `config.yml` sets the minimum time between accepted menu
clicks for each player, in milliseconds. It defaults to **75**, preserving the
existing behavior. A menu can override this value at its top level:

```yaml
# config.yml: default for menus without an override
click_cooldown_ms: 200
```

```yaml
# A menu file: override the global value for clicks accepted in this menu
click_cooldown_ms: 250
```

The cooldown starts when a click passes its requirements, before its actions run.
Clicks rejected during that time do not run requirements or actions and do not
extend the cooldown. Closing, refreshing or switching menus does not reset an
active cooldown. New settings apply to subsequent accepted clicks after reload.
Zero or negative values disable this general delay; the existing shift-click
workaround and `DOUBLE_CLICK` rejection still apply.
